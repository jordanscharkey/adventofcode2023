# Advent of Code 2023

This repo is merely to track the code I used to solve the questions to [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023). I've wanted to practice my C more, so the answers will be written as such.

If you have any questions feel free to reach out to `jordan@schark.online`. Follow me more over at [schark.online](https://schark.online/), where I track more personal projects that here on Github.
